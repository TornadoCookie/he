He(lium): A build system tailored for very specific programs made in raylib

Default platforms:
linux64: linux 64-bit with optimization
linux64-debug: linux 64-bit with debug symbols
win64: windows 64-bit with optimization
web: emscripten build (release)

note: he actually uses a custom HePlatforms for example purposes

it also adds some defines based on the platform
PLATFORM: the platform name
RELEASE: defined if release mode
DEBUG: defined if debug mode
EXEC_EXTENSION: extension of executable files
LIB_EXTENSION: extension of library files

Source structure:

<Root>
|->src - source files
|->lib - libraries
|->include - headers
|->build - home for built executables and object files-
|->HeFile - "make"file
|->HePlatforms - special options for each platform

HeFile directives:
DefaultPlatform [str]: sets the default value for the PLATFORM environment variable. (Default: linux64-debug)
DefaultDistDir [str]: sets the default value for the DISTDIR environment variable. (Default: .)
RaylibVersion [str]: sets the raylib version. (Default: 5)
UseRaylib [bool]: whether or not the project is using raylib.

Dependency [str]: Add a single-header header-only dependency. The makefile will look in lib/[dependency]/src and lib/[dependency]/include for the header.
NativeDependency [str]: Add a native dependency. The makefile will look in lib/[dependency]-[platform]/lib for the libraries and lib/[dependency]-[platform]/include for the headers.
ExtraCFlag [str]: Add an extra flag to GCC.
ExtraLDFlag [str]: Add an extra flag to GCC when linking.
ExtraCxxFlag [str]: Add an extra flag to GCC when compiling C++. Note that CFLAGS will also be added.
DistData [str]: Add a file to be included with distributions.

Program [str]: define a new program.
Library [str]: define a new library.
SourceGroup [str]: define a new source group.

Under a program or library directive:
UseSourceGroup [str]: Add the source files in the source group to the program.
Source [str]: Add a source file to the program.
CxxSource [str]: Add a C++ source file to the program as opposed to C.

HePlatforms directives:
Platform [str]: define a new platform.

Under a platform directive:
ExecExtension [str]: The file extension of an executable targeting this platform.
LibExtension [str]: The file extension of a shared/dynamic library targeting this platform.
StaticLibExtension [str]: The file extension of a static library targeting this platform.
Compiler [str]: The compiler to use. (Default value of the CC environment variable)
CxxCompiler [str]: The C++ compiler to use. (Default value of the CXX environment variable)
RaylibLdFlag [str]: The flag to be added to LDFLAGS when using raylib (on windows it is -lraylibdll while on linux it is just -lraylib.)
IsRelease [bool]: Whether or not the platform is meant for production. (Add optimization flags)
IsDebug [bool]: Whether or not the platform is meant for debugging. (Add debugging flags)
ExtraCFlag [str]: Add an extra flag to GCC for this platform only.
ExtraCxxFlag [str]: Add an extra C++ flag
